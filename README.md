This is a game where the enemy(computer) gets a random number between 20 and 30. You have 3 number slots which you can get a number between 1 and 10. The objective is to pass the enemy number by adding these 3 numbers you get randomly. You have 3 chance to get a random number and before your chance gets to zero you can hold the number you get. It is like rolling a dice. You can roll the dice 3 times and if you like the number you can keep it without rolling the dice again. Then you go to 2nd number which you do the same, get a random number, hold it if you like it or try your luck again.
